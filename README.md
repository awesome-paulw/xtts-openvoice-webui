# xtts-openvoice-webui
Xtts-openvoice-webui is a web interface that allows you to fine-tune your XTTS model based on your own needs, using text and SRT to generate high quality dubbing materials, and convert your voice feature based on a 15s audio clip in a simple click.  It is inspired by https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS and https://github.com/myshell-ai/OpenVoice and I am strived to make most of them.

Specificially, I fine-tuned the model for European Portuguese of which the TTS resources is rather limited.
